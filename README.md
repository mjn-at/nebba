**N**och **e**ine **B**ild**b**earbeitungs **A**pp (german) - means "Yet another image editing app"

  **This project will not be developed further.**

This was a project in a course in my studies in 2014.<br>
The goal was an app for editing images on android phone and tablet running android 'Jelly Bean', API level 18.<p>
  
  
  
The main-features that had to be provided by the application:

* The graphical interface of the application should be adapted to both phones and tablet computers.
* The application should be multilingual and support at least the German and English languages.
* The application should use the available memory efficiently (for example, using caching strategies) to allow higher resolution images to be processed. If an image is still too large for the available resources, the application should inform the user and not just crash.
* As image sources, the application should support the image gallery and the camera of that device.
* The display of an opened image should allow the enlargement / reduction (zoom) and shift (pan) of an image section.
* the following tools should be implemented
  * Color Manipulation: Adjust saturation and colorize an image.
  * Manipulation of the dynamic range: Adjusting the brightness and contrast, as well the calculation of an automatic histogram compensation.
  * Blur and sharpen an image.
  * Seam carving: Context-dependent scaling of an image, as well as the selective removal of image content.
* The application should make it possible to save a processed image under a new, possibly automatically generated, file name.
* The application should make it possible to undo (Undo) or restore (Redo) at least one work step.
